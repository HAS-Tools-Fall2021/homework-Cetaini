1/3: Nice work, I like your logic here, but your plots didn't come through. We will discuss this in class tomorrow and you can resubmit for full credit.

### Plot #1
![picture 1](../../images/d2ee8b08ce14596a9bf599e6a6ae7924495a39f112de0f93ab8334533207ac09.png)  

First take a glimpse of the data through its full time series. I have only changed the line style and color, but used a terser syntax. This plot offers a thorough idea of how flows change over time, and there is an obvious annual cycle.

### Plot #2

The first time series is too coarse, so I took a deeper look at more recent periods. The result shows an increasing trend for last two weeks but a decline trend at last day. So probably, the value will be smaller than 180.

### Plot #3

Then a histogram of October shows that normally flows in October will be around 120 or so.

### Plot #4

This plot shows October flows in years that share a similar flow in September with this year's. There are only five years share a similar fow in September, and basically those years' October flows are smaller than 130, but higher than 75 or so.

### Plot #5
![picture 5](../../images/af6926aa743252750ec73f286fdd6800117e1f78d799ded5dbd71320670d77ac.png)  
These are the same selected years, but showed in a multiple lines way. Through this plot, we can tell October flows are basically lower than 120, but higher than 70 or so.

### Plot #6
![picture 6](../../images/bda22c5a1078cc9eea267c70d0258e9f8abd009e6b2507c78653021d799115c5.png)  
In this plot, I tried to establish a linear relation between this year's September flow with last year's, and a predicted value is 214.80.

_________

        Combine all the information above (smaller than 180; around 120 or so; smaller than 130, but higher than 75 or so; lower than 120, but higher than 70 or so; 214.80), my last predicted value for next week is: 150. Value for next next week is 150 also.
